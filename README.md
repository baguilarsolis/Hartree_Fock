# Project: Hartree Fock Code

# Contributor(s): Brianna Aguilar, Eric Neuscamman

# Project Description: The purpose of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of computational methods, specifically how the calcualtions work.
#                      The code in this project includes lowest energy, Hartree-Fock calculations for H2, HeH+, and HF. 
#                      Vibrational energy calculations were also attempted, in order expand the level of understanding and include a chemical application.
